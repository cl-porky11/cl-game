re-add lines (maybe they would already work)

add sound

optimize-everything using mop and new collection-objects and -methods maybe

generic functions for 3d-rotation may be not general enough for most things

adding different types of rotations? (2D, 3D (quaternion-like), 3D (yaw/pitch/etc.), moreD)

more binary methods (interact/collide/repel/etc.) for different classes

maybe new types of generic functions for binays methods
(will only work if #<method interact (x y)> and #<method interact (y x)> do the same or have some constant difference)

new subsystems for modelling plots, conversations and persons
plots with something like petri nets?
conversations should be writable like dramas are written
  (p1:"bla" p2,sad:"..." p1,goes)
persons?


learn about common technics used for games/engines and varjo or glsl
